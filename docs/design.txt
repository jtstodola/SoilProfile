PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Create a program that will display input from the user for a soil profile. Determine 
if each horizon: O, A, E, B, C, and Parent Rock are present. For each layer prompt 
the user for the horizon depth, soil type, soil color, and if peds are present and 
their size. Display each output back to the user.

Nouns: soil profile, horizon, horizon depth, soil type, soil color, peds, ped size, output

Verbs: prompt, for, output
